        <h3>
            Iâ€™m April, a Front End Engineer and Designer working 
            remotely in rainy Vancouver, BC.
        </h3>
        <p>
            I spent the last four years working a hybrid role as a developer and a designer. I thrive the most when I am able to merge code and design in building solutions. Along with coding and developing apps, I have a passion for user research, usability testing and web accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am dedicated to work with establishments and projects that align with values of accessibility, social justice, equity, and inclusion. These days my time is spent coding, designing and prototyping. I also mentor newcomer self-identifying women to secure careers in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2019 I formed Techincolour, a community tech space that catered to Black, Indigenous and people of colour to learn about tech and to serve as a space to network with other BIPOC tech workers in the Lower Mainland.
